# About VFS
VFS Purdue is a student‑run aerospace and aviation organization at Purdue University. We design, build, and fly an autonomy‑enabled eVTOL aircraft for the [GoAERO Competition](https://www.goaeroprize.com/).

Our team brings together undergraduates from aeronautics, electrical engineering, computer science, and other disciplines to solve real‑world problems in aircraft design and software.

## Software & Autonomy Focus
Most of the work on GitHub lives in our `.github` organization repo,
where we maintain:

- **Perception and obstacle avoidance software**
- **Mission planning & flight control scripts**
- **Simulation & analysis tools** (Coming Soon)
- **CI/CD pipelines and documentation**
